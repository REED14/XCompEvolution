## Features Added to xcompmgr in XCompEvolution:
1. By using -P argument you can set as background for transparent 
   windows any image you would want. The image should be placed as
   usr/local/etc/XCompEvolution/bkg.bmp
2. By using -R argument with a integer after (for exemple: "-R 12") 
   your windows will have rounded corners with the radius of the
   integer (in our case, it will be the radius of 12)
